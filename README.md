# My First Portfolio Design
Copy and paste: http://yu2749luca.github.io/FirstPortfolio </br>
I made this website in May 2019 </br>
This was the first website that I made to impress interviewers and HR. I have made some major changes since then. And I decided to keep this version in order to see how much I have improved. I made this website for the purpose of able to put all my projects on a web to let the interviewers see them. However, my poor design could not do the job </br>

### Here are the few things that I believe that went wrong in my first portfolio web: </br>
1. The Cover Picture is slightly getting caught awkwardly by the top navigation bar </br>
2. Using same folder png to represents different projects was not a good design </br>
3. There were no titles/name for each project </br>
4. Color Combination of the web was just completely eye-hurting </br>

I have made some major changes to fix those mistakes. </br>
The current version is here: http://yu2749luca.github.io/  or http://hokangyu.com </br>
