This was the first website that I tried to impress interviewers and HR. I have made some major changes since then and I decided to keep to this version in order to see how much I have improved. I made this website for the purpose of able to put all my projects on a web to let the interviewers see them. However, my poor design could not do the best </br>

Here are the few things that I believe that went wrong in my first portfolio web: </br>
1. The Cover Picture is slightly getting caught awkwardly by the top bar </br>
2. Using same folder to represents different projects was not a good design </br>
3. There were no titles/name for each project </br>
4. Color Combination of the web was just completely eye-hurting </br>

I have made some major changes to fix those mistakes. </br>
