This is my personal website. 
Copy and paste: http://yu2749luca.github.io/FirstPortfolio
Then you shall see my website.

This is my first web. I am learning CSS, Html. And I'm planning on deploying this website with heroku later on.
The website shall eventually links to my projects and other front-end/back-end designs.
